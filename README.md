The folder contains all the scripts used in the analyses for the paper. The modelling scripts are organized into subfolders 
named: ANN, BRT, GAM, GEOS, LASSO, SGEOS and STG. For BRT, GAM and LASSO, the scripts including "Spatial" in their names
are where the geocoordinates of the data locations were included as covariates in the analyses. Also, for ANN, BRT and LASSO,
the functions for uncertainty estimation are either included in the modelling scripts or saved as separate files.
